Intel® Cilk™ Plus is an extension to the C and C++ languages to support data and task parallelism.  It is the easiest, quickest way to harness the power of both multicore and vector processing.  Visit [cilkplus.org](http://cilkplus.org) for details.

This project implements the Intel® Cilk™ Plus language extensions in the [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org) frontend for [LLVM](http://llvm.org).  The commercial version of Cilk Plus is available as part of the [Intel® C++ Composer XE compiler](http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-composer-xe/).  There is also an open source version available in the "cilkplus" branch of the GCC C/C++ compiler.  More information is available on [cilkplus.org](http://cilkplus.org/which-license).

Try Cilk Plus/LLVM
==================

_Note: Cilk Plus/LLVM does not yet support all of the Intel® Cilk™ Plus extensions.  See [Status](#status)._

### Requirements

Most software and hardware requirements are the same as for [LLVM](http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#requirements).  However, support is currently limited to 64 bit Linux and Mac OS X - see [status](#status) for details on supported configurations and known issues.

CMake version 2.8.8 or greater is required to compile compiler-rt.

### Getting the source code

```
$ git clone -b cilkplus https://github.com/cilkplus/llvm
$ git clone -b cilkplus https://github.com/cilkplus/clang llvm/tools/clang
$ git clone -b cilkplus https://github.com/cilkplus/compiler-rt llvm/projects/compiler-rt
```

The source code structure follows Clang/LLVM: http://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html.

### Building

Currently, only CMake-based building is supported.  Detailed instructions on how to build Clang/LLVM/Compiler-rt with CMake can be found in the following page: http://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html.  In the following command, make sure to replace `/install/prefix` with the location where you would like to install the binaries.

```
$ cd llvm
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/prefix -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86 ..
$ make && make install
```

_Mac OS X_

The basic steps are the same as above.  However, on Max OS X it is recommanded to build with the Clang compiler shipped with the OS.  Add the following definitions to the cmake command above.

```
-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
```

### Using

To use the newly installed compiler, add the following to your environment.  On Mac OS X, replace LD_LIBRARY_PATH with DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.

```
export PATH=$PATH:/install/prefix/bin
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$C_INCLUDE_PATH:/install/prefix/include
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:/install/prefix/include
export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:/install/prefix/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/install/prefix/lib
```

When you build a program that uses Intel® Cilk™ Plus extensions, add the following options to enable Cilk Plus support and link to the runtime library.
```
-fcilkplus -lcilkrts
```

### A simple program

```
#include <cilk/cilk.h>
#include <assert.h>

int fib(int n) {
  if (n < 2)
    return 1;
  int a = cilk_spawn fib(n-1);
  int b = fib(n-2);
  cilk_sync;
  return a + b;
}

int main() {
  int result = fib(30);
  assert(result == 1346269);
  return 0;
} 
```

Confirm that the compiler is working correctly by saving the above code code to a file.

```
$ clang -fcilkplus test.c -o test -lcilkrts
$ ./test
```

You can check that the code is executing in parallel by using the time command and CILK_NWORKERS environment variable to control the number of workers.

```
$ CILK_NWORKERS=1 time ./test
$ CILK_NWORKERS=2 time ./test
$ CILK_NWORKERS=4 time ./test
```

### Supported platforms

OS: Linux or Mac OS X
Architecture: x86-64

### Known issues

* In C++, initializing a variable from a spawn that may throw an exception does not work yet. E.g.

```
_Cilk_spawn may_throw(); // OK
Foo f = _Cilk_spawn may_throw(); // not working yet
Foo f = _Cilk_spawn will_not_throw(); // OK
```

* There appear to be edge-cases in exception handling that do not work correctly, particularly with nested spawns.
* Using variable-length arrays in a spawning function does not work yet.
